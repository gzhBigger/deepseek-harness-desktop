/**
 * The shell-owned sidebar browser: one native `WebContentsView` driven by the DSH page.
 *
 * Why a native view instead of DSH's own browser tab: this surface, its session, its
 * navigation policy and (in the next milestone) its agent tools are all ours, so a DSH
 * upgrade cannot take the feature away. The panel UI is a DSH client plugin that registers
 * into the right sidebar; it only *measures* and *drives* this view.
 *
 * Layout contract with the panel:
 *   - the panel reports its stage rect in DSH viewport coordinates;
 *   - `toWindowRect` shifts it below the shell title strip and clamps it to the window;
 *   - a collapsed or hidden panel parks the view off-screen (`BROWSER_HIDDEN_RECT`), since
 *     `WebContentsView` has no `setVisible(false)` and removing the child view would throw
 *     away focus, scroll position and media state.
 *
 * One document, one view: `multiple` instances are deliberately out of scope for this
 * milestone, so closing the last panel tab destroys the view.
 *
 * Adapted from OneCode (`apps/desktop/src/main/browser/BrowserManager.ts`, MIT): view
 * creation/offscreen parking, the navigation event -> state push, `setWindowOpenHandler`
 * and the `will-navigate` policy shape (its multi-tab, device-emulation, picker, download
 * and certificate handling are intentionally not carried over yet).
