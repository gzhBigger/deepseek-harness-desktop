/**
 * Static guards for the settings page.
 *
 * The same class of bug the market page hit four times lives here too: nothing else in the repo sees
 * the interaction between this markup, its CSS and its script, and the window-level smoke cannot
 * either — `did-finish-load` fires happily for a page whose script throws before its first paint.
 *
 * Phone access used to live here; it moved to its own window (`pocket-ui`, guarded by
 * `pocket-ui.test.ts`) so one setting never grows two screens. This file also pins that the *settings*
 * form can no longer carry phone-access values: a save from here must not silently reset the gateway.
